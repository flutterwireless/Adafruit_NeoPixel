Flutter NeoPixel library
=========================

This library has been modified from the "Adafruit Neopixel Library" for use with Flutter microcontroller boards. Include Flutter_NeoPixel.h instead of Adafruit_NeoPixel.h and then use normally. Original library notes follow.

Arduino library for controlling single-wire-based LED pixels and strip such as the [Adafruit 60 LED/meter Digital LED strip][strip], the [Adafruit FLORA RGB Smart Pixel][flora], the [Adafruit Breadboard-friendly RGB Smart Pixel][pixel], the [Adafruit NeoPixel Stick][stick], and the [Adafruit NeoPixel Shield][shield].

After downloading, rename folder to 'Adafruit_NeoPixel' and install in Arduino Libraries folder. Restart Arduino IDE, then open File->Sketchbook->Library->Adafruit_NeoPixel->strandtest sketch.
